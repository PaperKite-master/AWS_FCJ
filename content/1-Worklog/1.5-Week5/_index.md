- Unify the Architecture with the Back-End: Unify the AWS services to be used and the communication process between FE and BE (API).
- Solve technical problems (Troubleshooting): Act as technical support, fix errors (blockers) that teammates encounter to ensure the overall progress.
- Prepare sample data (Mocking): Create sample product data on the interface while waiting for the Back-End to complete the API.
