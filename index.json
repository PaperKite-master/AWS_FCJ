With Amazon EFS you can flexibly share POSIX files across accounts and mount the same file system to multiple Amazon EKS clusters. This guide shows how to set up cross-account mounts for one EFS file system in a shared services account and attach it to an EKS cluster in another account.\nArchitecture and notes Establish secure network connectivity between VPCs in the two accounts via VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway. Deploy EFS in Regional mode and create mount targets in every AZ to avoid inter-AZ data transfer costs. Use AZ IDs (for example, use1-az1) instead of AZ names (us-east-1a) to point to the same physical location across accounts. Mount by File System ID and use an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for internal DNS resolution. Install AWS EFS CSI Driver ≥ 1.36.0 on EKS nodes; see installing amazon-efs-utils. Example accounts EFS account (shared services): 111111111111, File System ID: fs-0c492f870b90c1c9a. EKS account: 222222222222, cluster EKS-cross-account-cluster. Steps Step 1: Check EFS in account 111111111111 Open the EFS console, choose the Region, and open the file system ID. In Network, ensure mount targets exist in every AZ. If missing, create them following Managing mount targets. Step 2: Record EFS networking info From the Network tab, note VPC ID, AZ ID, and IPv4 for each mount target. You’ll use this for Route 53 and connectivity checks. Step 3: Record EKS cluster info in account 222222222222 In the EKS console, select cluster EKS-cross-account-cluster and the appropriate Region. In Networking, capture the VPC ID and Cluster security group. Step 4: Create a VPC peering connection between the two VPCs From the EKS account (222222222222), go to VPC \u0026gt; Peering connections \u0026gt; Create peering connection. Set VPC requester to the EKS VPC (Step 3); Account to Another Account and enter the EFS account ID 111111111111. Region: choose the same Region (for example, us-west-1). VPC accepter: paste the EFS VPC ID (Step 2). Ensure the two VPC CIDRs do not overlap. Choose Create. Step 5: Accept the peering request in the EFS account Sign in to account 111111111111, navigate to VPC \u0026gt; Peering connections. Select the request with status Pending acceptance and click Accept request. The status changes to Active. Step 6: Update route tables in both accounts In the EKS account, open Route tables, choose the table used by EKS nodes, and select Edit routes. Add route: Destination = CIDR of the EFS VPC; Target = the peering connection created. Save. Repeat in the EFS account: Destination = CIDR of the EKS VPC; Target = the same peering connection. Step 7: Open inbound NFS on the EFS Security Group In the EFS account, on the file system Network tab, copy the Security Group ID attached to mount targets. Go to VPC \u0026gt; Security groups, select that SG, choose Edit inbound rules. Add a rule: Type: NFS Source: 222222222222/sg-\u0026lt;cluster-sg-id\u0026gt; (Owner ID of the EKS account + the EKS cluster SG from Step 3). Step 8: Create a Route 53 private hosted zone in the EKS account Create one private hosted zone per AZ ID using the pattern:\n\u0026lt;availability-zone-id\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;file-system-id\u0026gt;.efs.\u0026lt;region\u0026gt;.amazonaws.com Associate the hosted zone with the EKS VPC. In each hosted zone, add an A record pointing to the mount target IP for that AZ (from Step 2).\nExample in us-west-1 with AZ IDs usw1-az3 and usw1-az1: usw1-az3.fs-0c492f870b90c1c9a.efs.us-west-1.amazonaws.com → IP of mount target in usw1-az3 usw1-az1.fs-0c492f870b90c1c9a.efs.us-west-1.amazonaws.com → IP of mount target in usw1-az1 Step 9: Create a cross-account IAM role in the EFS account Set environment variables: export EKS_ACCOUNT_ID=222222222222 export EFS_ACCOUNT_ID=111111111111 Create a trust policy for EFSCrossAccountAccessRole allowing the EKS account to assume it: cat \u0026gt;

With correct VPC peering, route tables, security groups, Route 53 DNS, IAM permissions, and the EFS CSI Driver, Amazon EKS clusters can access a shared EFS file system without duplicating data, optimizing cost and operations.\nAuthors Samyak Kathane – Senior Solutions Architect specializing in AWS storage (Amazon EFS), helping customers build reliable, high-performance, cost-optimized systems.\nRaja Pamuluri – Senior Storage Solutions Architect focused on the Energy sector, helping customers design and deploy large-scale cloud storage solutions.\nVenkat Penmetsa – Senior Technical Account Manager specializing in Amazon EKS, helping customers operate and optimize Kubernetes on AWS.\n"},{"uri":"https://paperkite-master.github.io/AWS_FCJ/3-blogstranslated/3.2-blog2/","title":"Blog 2","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Creative coding for everyone: Pi Jam expands digital skills for underserved learners in India with AWS by Mohammed Reda and Aanya Niaz, 01 OCT 2025 – categories: Customer Solutions, EdTechs, Education, Public Sector | Permalink | Share\nIndia’s National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020 – National Education Policy 2020) calls for technology to play a central role in equitable, high-quality education, emphasizing “online and digital education: ensuring equitable use of technology.” Yet reliable connectivity and devices remain out of reach for many students, especially in rural and public schools:\nAccording to the UDISE+ 2023–24 report (Unified District Information System for Education Plus), only 53.9% of Indian schools have internet connectivity and 57.2% have computers. At the household level, 67.6% of children live in homes with a smartphone, but 26.1% still cannot access the device even when it exists, per the Annual Status of Education Report. These gaps limit millions of students from reaching creative computing skills and problem-solving as outlined by NEP 2020. This is where the Pi Jam Foundation — a nonprofit committed to bringing creative coding and digital skills to underserved students using Amazon Web Services (AWS) — steps in to bridge the digital divide.\nPi Jam Foundation and Code Mitra: Cloud-native from day one Pi Jam Foundation built Code Mitra, a modular open platform that delivers creative coding to students and teachers across India. The platform uses block-based programming (block-based programming) to build 21st-century skills like logic, problem-solving, and collaboration. Projects are localized, from water conservation models in Kashmir to traffic optimization in Maharashtra.\nThe platform integrates with national LMSs such as DIKSHA. Designed for low-resource environments, Code Mitra runs on low-cost Android phones and supports offline use; teachers have built-in professional development tools and can co-create local content.\nFrom the start, Code Mitra runs fully on AWS for reliability and scalability, leveraging AWS Lambda, Amazon Aurora, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon ElastiCache, and other managed services. Pi Jam also uses Amazon Bedrock to score ideas for large student hackathons and extend AI for Scratch, enabling students to experiment with AI in a visual creative-coding environment.\nImpact at national scale Since launch, Code Mitra has reached 1.14 million students across 95% of India’s districts. Seventy-six percent of learners access lessons on low-cost devices; context-based activities achieve 58% completion, with 30% of students submitting original ideas. Over 11,000 teachers across 14 districts have been trained; 71% say activities are easy to localize and 84% report higher classroom engagement.\nOn the technology side, Pi Jam reports a 30% improvement in API response times after modernizing the platform with AWS managed services, delivering smoother experiences even in low-bandwidth settings.\nSupport from the Education Equity Initiative The AWS Education Equity Initiative (EEI) provides promotional credits that help Pi Jam expand quickly in underserved regions. This support enabled India’s largest student hackathon – the Eco Creativity and Innovation Hackathon with over 700,000 participants and 200,000 ideas – and funded state-level learning portals such as the Code Mitra variant for Telangana. These efforts let public-school students and teachers across the state access structured creative-coding pathways and localized resources, demonstrating EEI’s sustainable impact.\nFuture plans Pi Jam aims to reach another 1 million students by 03/2026 and 7 million by 03/2028, prioritizing rural and public schools. Planned features include AI-driven personalized learning paths and a content recommendation system.\nConclusion Pi Jam Foundation shows how a cloud-native approach on AWS can scale creative coding for learners at risk of being left behind. With ongoing support from the AWS Education Equity Initiative, the organization is poised to reach millions more students and introduce AI-powered personalization, ensuring every child — regardless of device or connectivity — gains the skills to thrive in a digital future.\nExplore how your education program can use the cloud to expand access and improve learning outcomes at the AWS Education page.\nTAGS: Amazon Aurora, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, AWS Public Sector, customer story, EdTech, education\nMohammed Reda\nSenior solutions architect at AWS.

Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow.

Data before models: optimize pipelines, indexing, caching, and latency. Safety \u0026amp; compliance: guardrails, auditability, continuous monitoring \u0026amp; evaluation. Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first: small, high-impact problems with clear owners \u0026amp; data. Ubiquitous language: align business–tech and lock KPIs/ROI early. Technical Architecture Prefer RAG and agentic patterns; separate orchestrator from tools. Observability \u0026amp; Eval: tracing, offline/online evaluation, feedback loops. Cost \u0026amp; Performance: fit-for-purpose models, batching/caching, prompt/context optimization, latency control. Modernization Strategy Roadmap PoC → pilot → limited rollout → scale with exit criteria per stage. Build on AWS foundations for security, resilience, and scalability. Applying to Work Shortlist 1–2 GenAI use cases tied to clear KPIs; prepare data \u0026amp; access. Run a 6–8 week PoC with go/no-go gates (quality, latency, cost/interaction, adoption). Ops plan: monitoring, guardrails, human-in-the-loop, continuous improvement. Event Experience The event offered a clear path to move from vision to value: deploying GenAI into real workflows with security, cost awareness, and business alignment. Talks and demos showed how to standardize the data pipeline, implement RAG/agents, and measure impact to unlock pilot \u0026amp; scale.\n"},{"uri":"https://paperkite-master.github.io/AWS_FCJ/5-workshop/5.2-prerequiste/","title":"Prerequisites","tags":[],"description":"","content":"IAM Permissions Create an IAM role with Permissions policies: AmazonBedrockFullAccess and CloudWatchLogsFullAccess\n"},{"uri":"https://paperkite-master.github.io/AWS_FCJ/2-proposal/","title":"Proposal","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\u0026ldquo;Leaf\u0026rdquo; Clothing E-commerce Website Using AWS Services Integration to Optimize the System (S3, CloudWatch, etc.) 1.

These components deliver a fully serverless architecture with low cost and automatic scaling.\nMain Components: Amazon Bedrock (AI Engine) – Provides the Claude Haiku 4.5 model through a simple API. You call the InvokeModel API to send messages and receive intelligent AI responses.\nAWS Lambda (Backend Logic) – Runs Node.js 24 code to process requests from API Gateway. Lambda validates input (message length, history limits), formats prompts for Bedrock, calls the Bedrock API, and handles errors.\nAPI Gateway (REST API Endpoint) – Creates a public HTTPS endpoint (POST /chat) for the frontend to call. API Gateway handles CORS configuration, routes requests to Lambda, and provides throttling to protect the backend from abuse.\nAmazon S3 (Frontend Hosting) – Hosts a static website (HTML) for the chatbot UI. Users access the chatbot through the browser; the interface sends messages to API Gateway and displays AI responses.\nCloudWatch (Monitoring \u0026amp; Debugging) – Automatically collects logs from Lambda execution, allowing you to debug errors.\nArchitecture Overview User Browser → S3 (Static Website) → API Gateway → Lambda → Bedrock (Claude) → CloudWatch\nFlow:\nUser enters a message in the chatbot UI (hosted on S3) JavaScript sends a POST request to the API Gateway endpoint API Gateway invokes the Lambda function Lambda validates input, formats the prompt, and calls the Bedrock InvokeModel API Bedrock processes it with Claude Haiku 4.5 and returns the AI response Lambda returns the response back to API Gateway → Browser CloudWatch logs the entire process Workshop Modules Module 1: Setup Amazon Bedrock\n• Enable Claude Haiku 4.5 model access\n• Understand inference profiles\n• Test the model via AWS Console\nModule 2: Create Lambda Function\n• Create a Node.js 24 Lambda function\n• Deploy chatbot backend code\n• Configure IAM role with Bedrock permissions\n• Set environment variables\nModule 3: Configure API Gateway\n• Create REST API\n• Configure POST /chat endpoint\n• Enable CORS\n• Test API with Postman\nModule 4: Deploy Frontend to S3\n• Create S3 bucket\n• Enable static website hosting\n• Upload HTML chatbot UI\n• Configure public access\nModule 5: Testing \u0026amp; Debugging\n• Test end-to-end flow\n• View CloudWatch logs\n"},{"uri":"https://paperkite-master.github.io/AWS_FCJ/5-workshop/5.6-monitoring-cloudwatch/","title":"Monitoring with CloudWatch","tags":[],"description":"","content":"1.
